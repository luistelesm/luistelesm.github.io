Welcome! I am a **PhD candidate in Economics** at [Nova School of Business and Economics](http://novasbe.pt). **I am on the 2025/26 academic job market.**

My research interests lie in **macroeconomics and finance**, focusing on housing, household finance, consumption and saving, and monetary and fiscal policy.

During the PhD, I have been a visiting student at [NYU Stern](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/about/departments-centers-initiatives/academic-departments/finance), [Baruch College](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/), and [U. Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/web/econ/). I also worked at the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html).

**Mortgage structure, household saving, and the wealth distribution**<br>[(PDF)](/files/JMP_Luis_Teles_Morais.pdf)

<summary>Abstract</summary>

   Mortgage repayments make up 30% of Euro-area household saving flows. I show that fixed amortization schedules, mandatory in most countries, induce wealth accumulation through debt repayment but limit consumption smoothing. In a life-cycle model with uninsurable income risk and illiquid home equity, costly deviation from scheduled repayment forces constrained homeowners to cut consumption and liquid saving. In the data, homebuyers are constrained: starting with large mortgages and little cash, they save more than renters (including debt repayment) but accumulate less liquid wealth. I exploit a 2013 Dutch policy change that made previously-free flexible repayment costly through tax incentives. Homebuyers accelerated repayment and built less liquid buffers. The model matches these patterns and shows mandatory amortization increases the share of hand-to-mouth households by 15 percentage points, amplifying financial wealth inequality. Welfare losses, at 2–3% of lifetime consumption – equivalent to working an extra year before retirement – are concentrated among lower-income households.<br><br>

**The cost of homeownership** <br> with [João B. Duarte](https://jbduarte.com) and [Francisco Rodrigues](https://www.novasbe.unl.pt/en/programs/phds/phd-in-economics-finance/phd-students/current-phd-students/id/1179/francisco-franca-rodrigues)<br>[(PDF)](/files/HAI_31102025.pdf)

<summary>Abstract</summary>
Conventional housing affordability metrics contradict the widespread perception of a secular rise in the cost of homeownership. The main index used by policymakers — based on mortgage-payment-to-income ratios — suggests affordability today is similar to 2000 and better than in the 1980s. Yet homeownership has declined among younger generations, who report feeling ‘priced out’. We develop a microfounded measure of homeownership cost that resolves this disconnect. Within a standard income fluctuations model with explicit housing finance, we compute the welfare cost of becoming a homeowner as the consumption-equivalent loss relative to free housing, isolating the cost of ownership from shifts in rent-price ratios. Unlike conventional metrics, this captures the full intertemporal burden: saving for a downpayment, purchasing the house, and servicing a mortgage. Our measure shows that median first-time buyers in the US faced a 30% increase in costs since 2000, rising to 60% for low-earners, while the top income quintile saw no increase — consistent with conventional metrics, which reflect the experience of wealthier households. Tighter macroprudential policies contributed to the increase by raising downpayment requirements. The measure is data-light and theoretically sound, providing a practical tool to assess housing affordability over the income distribution and across time and countries.<br><br>

<summary>Abstract</summary>
 How does monetary policy affect household portfolio composition? Resorting to highly granular data on the balance sheets of Norwegian households, we analyze how their wealth portfolios change in response to well-identified monetary policy shocks. We document new empirical facts about how household portfolios adjust to monetary tightening: i) total portfolio size rises initially but contracts after two years; ii) risky asset values decline, while housing wealth increases briefly before falling, with secondary residences showing a pronounced short-run rise; iii) financially active households rebalance by increasing their holdings of stocks and private-equity; iv) decreases in risky asset values are concentrated among the wealthiest households; v) housing responses are highly heterogeneous, with richer households expanding primary and secondary housing; vi) holding adjustments vary across the wealth distribution: stock holdings increase slightly more at the top, while private-equity increases are concentrated in the tails.<br><br>

**The costs of building walls: immigration and the fiscal burden of aging in Europe** <br> with [Tiago Bernardino](https://www.tiagobernardino.com) and [Francesco Franco](https://economicsforpolicy.novasbe.pt/people/francesco-franco/)<br> [(paper)](/files/Costs_of_Building_Walls.pdf)

<summary>Abstract</summary>
In low-fertility societies with working-age immigration, reducing inflows disproportionately raises dependency ratios. This creates a convex policy frontier: restricting immigration raises fiscal burdens at an increasing rate. We quantify this mechanism using a demographic model and novel estimates of immigrants’ fiscal contributions in the euro area. Eliminating immigration raises the tax increase required to finance aging-related spending by 16%, while doubling inflows reduces it by only 9%. Differences across countries are substantial, reflecting their positions on the frontier as well as heterogeneity in immigrants’ ages and national tax-benefit systems. Immigration improves fiscal balances even when migrants are low-skilled, as long as their lifetime contributions exceed those of newborn natives. Higher native fertility offers no comparable relief.<br><br>
