# Luís Teles Morais

Welcome! I am a **PhD candidate in Economics** at [Nova School of Business and Economics](http://novasbe.pt).

During the PhD, I have been a visiting student at [NYU Stern](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/about/departments-centers-initiatives/academic-departments/finance), at [Baruch College, CUNY](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/), and at [U. Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/web/econ/). I also worked at the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html) as a PhD trainee and research analyst.

My research interests are between macroeconomics and finance, focusing on household finance, consumption and saving, and housing. My supervisors are [**João B. Duarte**](https://jbduarte.com) and [**Francesco Franco**](https://www.novasbe.unl.pt/en/faculty-research/faculty/faculty-detail/id/55/francesco-franco).

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
 Population aging strains public finances by raising old-age dependency ratios. We show that immigration alleviates this fiscal burden when it is mostly composed of working-age individuals, even if they are low- skilled. Revisiting the standard population projection model, we demonstrate that increasing immigration flows decreases future dependency ratios, relieving public finances. We also unveil the decreasing returns of this effect, which make restricting immigration more costly. Combining this framework with rich micro data on taxes and benefits, we find that interrupting immigration flows would increase the fiscal burden of aging in the Euro area by 20%, with substantial variation across countries. Increasing fertility is not an alternative, as the benefits of a larger labor force only emerge after 40 years and do not offset higher ed- ucation spending. Our findings indicate that restricting immigration in Europe can substantially increase the tax burden on native workers.<br><br>
