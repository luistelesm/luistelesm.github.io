Welcome! I am a **PhD candidate in Economics** at [Nova School of Business and Economics](http://novasbe.pt). **I am on the 2025/26 academic job market.**

My research interests lie in **macroeconomics and finance**, focusing on housing, household finance, consumption and saving, and monetary and fiscal policy.

During the PhD, I have been a visiting student at [NYU Stern](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/about/departments-centers-initiatives/academic-departments/finance), [Baruch College](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/), and [U. Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/web/econ/). I also worked at the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html).

**Mortgage structure, saving rates, and the wealth distribution**<br>[(paper)](/files/JMP_Luis_Teles_Morais.pdf)

<summary>Abstract</summary>

 Abstract Mortgage repayments account for 30% of household saving flows in the Euro area. Much of this saving is not chosen freely: rigid mortgage structures impose mandatory amortization schedules that induce wealth accumulation through debt repayment, but limit consumption smoothing. I develop a life-cycle model with uninsurable income risk and illiquid housing wealth, where deviating from the scheduled mortgage repayment is costly. Binding repayment schedules then generate large responses through precautionary saving motives. In Euro area data, younger and lower-income mortgaged homeowners save substantially more than renters but accumulate less liquid wealth – except in the Netherlands, where flexible interest-only contracts are common. I calibrate the model to Dutch HFCS data spanning a 2013 policy change that increased the cost of this flexibility for new homebuyers, matching observed debt repayment and liquid wealth patterns over the life cycle and across permanent-income groups. The model shows how mandatory amortization raises total saving but crowds out liquid wealth, especially early in the life-cycle and for lower-income households. Applying the 2013 regime to pre-2013 homebuyers would increase the share of hand-to-mouth households – those with small liquid wealth buffers – by 15 percentage points, raising consumption volatility and marginal propensities to consume. Welfare losses are substantial – equivalent to 2-3% of lifetime consumption – and concentrated among lower-wealth households who value payment flexibility most. Mandatory amortization, unavoidable in most countries, reduces homeowners’ ability to smooth consumption, amplifying financial wealth inequality.<br><br>

**The cost of homeownership** <br> with [João B. Duarte](https://jbduarte.com) and [Francisco Rodrigues](https://www.novasbe.unl.pt/en/programs/phds/phd-in-economics-finance/phd-students/current-phd-students/id/1179/francisco-franca-rodrigues)<br>[(paper)](/files/HAI_31102025.pdf)

<summary>Abstract</summary>
Conventional housing affordability metrics contradict the widespread perception of a secular rise in the cost of homeownership. The main index used by policymakers — based on mortgage-payment-to-income ratios — suggests affordability today is similar to 2000 and better than in the 1980s. Yet homeownership has declined among younger generations, who report feeling ‘priced out’. We develop a microfounded measure of homeownership cost that resolves this disconnect. Within a standard income fluctuations model with explicit housing finance, we compute the welfare cost of becoming a homeowner as the consumption-equivalent loss relative to free housing, isolating the cost of ownership from shifts in rent-price ratios. Unlike conventional metrics, this captures the full intertemporal burden: saving for a downpayment, purchasing the house, and servicing a mortgage. Our measure shows that median first-time buyers in the US faced a 30% increase in costs since 2000, rising to 60% for low-earners, while the top income quintile saw no increase — consistent with conventional metrics, which reflect the experience of wealthier households. Tighter macroprudential policies contributed to the increase by raising downpayment requirements. The measure is data-light and theoretically sound, providing a practical tool to assess housing affordability over the income distribution and across time and countries.<br><br>

<summary>Abstract</summary>
How does monetary policy affect household portfolio composition? Resorting to highly granular data on the balance sheets of Norwegian households, we analyze how their wealth portfolios change in response to well-defined monetary policy shocks. We document three empirical facts on the aggregate response of households after a 1 percentage point increase in the policy rate: i) the total value of households' portfolios decreases by 4.1% two years after the shock; ii) monetary policy tightening decreases the risk exposure of portfolios, in particular the value of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds; iii) stock market participation is unaffected by monetary policy, but those who already own stocks increase their holdings. We find pronounced heterogeneity in the responses, noting these additional facts: iv) the drop in risky asset values is mostly driven by the wealthiest 10 percent, while a short-term positive response of safe assets comes from middle-class households' portfolios; v) middle‑aged homeowners benefit from a short-term house price appreciation, but for younger households, the effect becomes negative over time, indicating that tighter policy delays entry into home ownership.<br><br>

**The costs of building walls: immigration and the fiscal burden of aging in Europe** <br> with [Tiago Bernardino](https://www.tiagobernardino.com) and [Francesco Franco](https://economicsforpolicy.novasbe.pt/people/francesco-franco/)<br> [(paper)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4932922)

<summary>Abstract</summary>
In low-fertility societies with working-age immigration, reducing inflows disproportionately raises dependency ratios. This creates a convex policy frontier: restricting immigration raises fiscal burdens at an increasing rate. We quantify this mechanism using a demographic model and novel estimates of immigrants’ fiscal contributions in the euro area. Eliminating immigration raises the tax increase required to finance aging-related spending by 16%, while doubling inflows reduces it by only 9%. Differences across countries are substantial, reflecting their positions on the frontier as well as heterogeneity in immigrants’ ages and national tax-benefit systems. Immigration improves fiscal balances even when migrants are low-skilled, as long as their lifetime contributions exceed those of newborn natives. Higher native fertility offers no comparable relief.<br><br>
