Welcome! I am a **PhD candidate in Economics** at [Nova School of Business and Economics](http://novasbe.pt). **I am on the 2025/26 academic job market.**

My research interests lie between macroeconomics and finance, focusing on housing, household finance, consumption and saving. 

During the PhD, I have been a visiting student at [NYU Stern](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/experience-stern/about/departments-centers-initiatives/academic-departments/finance), at [Baruch College, CUNY](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/), and at [U. Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/web/econ/). I also worked at the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html).

### Job Market Paper

**Mortgage structure, saving rates, and the wealth distribution**

 <details>

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

 In this paper, I show that fixed amortization schedules have powerful and heterogeneous effects on household consumption, saving and wealth. I study an otherwise standard life-cycle model with realistic mortgages, showing that homeowners rationally respond to mandatory repayments by cutting consumption and increasing precautionary saving in liquid assets. Consistent with this mechanism, I document in Euro area data that younger, poorer homeowners have much higher saving rates than their non-mortgage peers, and allocate a large share of sav- ing to mortgage repayment. The exception is the Netherlands, where interest-only mortgages are common. This complements recent quasi-experimental evidence showing large effects of amortization requirements on saving. A quantitative version of the model reproduces these facts and shows that mandatory amortization increases both home equity and financial wealth accumulation, particularly up to age 40. Wealth-to-income ratios increase by close to a quarter for lower-income homeowners at age 40, while the impact for the highest-income households is minimal. These effects build up over time and have substantial implications for aggregate consumption and wealth: mandatory amortization dampens total wealth inequality, but increases consumption volatility and financial wealth inequality.<br><br>

**The cost of homeownership** <br> with [João B. Duarte](https://jbduarte.com) and [Francisco Rodrigues](https://www.novasbe.unl.pt/en/programs/phds/phd-in-economics-finance/phd-students/current-phd-students/id/1179/francisco-franca-rodrigues)

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
We argue that current metrics for the cost of homeownership inadequately represent the actual cost burden faced by potential homeowners and fail to capture household heterogeneity. In this paper, we develop a novel, fully microfounded measure of homeownership cost based on household’s dynamic decision to buy versus rent by comparing the welfare consequences of each alternative. Formally, we define the cost of homeownership as the welfare loss incurred by committing to a purchase relative to remaining a renter. This framework incorporates key dimensions typically overlooked by conventional measures, such as uninsurable labor income risk, liquidity constraints, and mortgage market frictions — including down payments and interest rate dynamics. Moreover, by accounting for household heterogeneity, our measure captures distributional differences, revealing, for instance, how the cost of becoming a homeowner may be rising for lower-income households even when aggregate indicators suggest stable affordability.<br><br>

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
How does monetary policy affect household portfolio composition? Resorting to highly granular data on the balance sheets of Norwegian households, we analyze how their wealth portfolios change in response to well-defined monetary policy shocks. We document three empirical facts on the aggregate response of households after a 1 percentage point increase in the policy rate: i) the total value of households' portfolios decreases by 4.1% two years after the shock; ii) monetary policy tightening decreases the risk exposure of portfolios, in particular the value of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds; iii) stock market participation is unaffected by monetary policy, but those who already own stocks increase their holdings. We find pronounced heterogeneity in the responses, noting these additional facts: iv) the drop in risky asset values is mostly driven by the wealthiest 10 percent, while a short-term positive response of safe assets comes from middle-class households' portfolios; v) middle‑aged homeowners benefit from a short-term house price appreciation, but for younger households, the effect becomes negative over time, indicating that tighter policy delays entry into home ownership.<br><br>

<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
 In low-fertility societies with working-age immigration, reducing inflows disproportionately raises dependency ratios as native populations shrink. This creates a convex policy frontier: restricting migration raises fiscal burdens at an increasing rate. We quantify this mechanism using a demographic model and novel estimates of immigrants’ fiscal contributions in the Euro area. Eliminating immigration raises the fiscal burden of aging by 16%, despite immigrants' low skills, while doubling inflows reduces it by 9%. Differences across countries are substantial, reflecting their positions on the frontier, but also heterogeneity in immigrants' ages and tax-benefit policies. Increasing natives' fertility does not provide comparable relief.<br><br>
