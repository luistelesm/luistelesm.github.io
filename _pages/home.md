I am a **PhD candidate in Economics at [Nova School of Business and Economics](http://novasbe.pt)**.

I work under the supervision of [Francesco Franco](https://www.novasbe.unl.pt/en/faculty-research/faculty/faculty-detail/id/55/francesco-franco) and [Jo√£o B. Duarte](https://jbduarte.com). My research interests lie in macroeconomics, household finance and public finance.
